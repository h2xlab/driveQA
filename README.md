## Overview

DriveQA is a comprehensive multimodal benchmark that evaluates driving knowledge through text-based and vision-based question-answering tasks. The dataset simulates real-world driving knowledge tests, assessing LLMs and MLLMs on traffic regulations, sign recognition, and right-of-way reasoning.

## Supported Tasks

- **Text-based QA**: Traffic rules, safety regulations, right-of-way principles
- **Vision-based QA**: Traffic sign recognition, intersection scene understanding  
- **Multimodal Reasoning**: Combined visual and textual reasoning for driving scenarios

## Dataset Structure

### DriveQA-T (Text-based QA)
- **Samples**: 26,143 QA pairs + 1,249 challenging samples
- **Categories**: 19 subcategories grouped into 5 major domains (Basic Safety, Lane Rules, Special Cases, Road Signs, Emergencies)
- **Format**: Multiple-choice questions with explanations

### DriveQA-V (Vision-based QA)
- **Samples**: 448K image-text QA pairs
- **Image Sources**: CARLA simulator + Mapillary real-world data
- **Coverage**: 220 US traffic signs, diverse environmental conditions (weather, lighting, perspective, distance)
- **Task Types**: Traffic sign recognition, right-of-way judgment

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Built from official driver's manuals of all 50 US states plus DC
- **Environmental Diversity**: Synthetic data with varied weather, lighting, and viewing angles
- **Real-world Validation**: Mapillary data enables sim-to-real transfer evaluation
- **Controlled Variations**: Supports systematic ablation studies and model sensitivity analysis
